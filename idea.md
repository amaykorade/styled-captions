1. Problem

Short-form video creators on Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and similar platforms struggle to:

Add captions quickly and accurately.

Make captions look visually engaging (colors, fonts, animations).

Decide when captions should appear so the video doesn’t feel cluttered.
Existing auto-caption tools give plain subtitles for the entire video and rarely match a creator’s style.

2. Solution

A web app where a user uploads a short-form video. The app:

Transcribes the audio accurately (using Whisper API or similar).

Identifies only key/attention-grabbing phrases automatically (AI highlights most important parts).

Generates styled captions (font, size, color, animation presets) that overlay perfectly on the video.

Lets the user customize captions — edit text, choose colors, move position.

Exports the final video ready to post on TikTok/Instagram/YouTube.
